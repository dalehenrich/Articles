In January of 1985 I started working in Tektronix Smalltalk. 
At that time you used change sets to manage code.
Believe it or not, when a team worked with Smalltalk in those days, the image was passed around from developer to developer and each of the developers integrated her changes into the “master image”. 
At that time I had been working in FORTRAN for a 4 years or so and (silly me) I wanted to be able to be able to build my image from scratch without having to manually integrate change sets.
I wrote a tool that saved change sets to disk (early form of package) and used RCS (predecessor to CVS) to version the code. 
I used a predecessor to the [Change Sorter][1] tool to sort changes for a unit of work into the "packages" before saving it.
Ward Cunningham created the Change Sorter after I gave him a demo of the tool that I was using:)
